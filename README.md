This is my personal website that can be accessed via: [ErikRichardS.github.io](https://erikrichards.github.io/)

It's mainly something I occasionally fiddle with because I like the idea of having my own website with some pointless but fun functionality. 

## Games
Currently the website has two games that can be "played". The first one is Game of Life that is completely pointless game with no defined endpoint. The second one is classic Snake. You know Snake, right?
