This is my personal website that can be accessed via: [ErikRichardS.github.io](ErikRichardS.github.io)

It's something I occasionally fiddle with to add function. 

## Games
Currently the website has two games that can be "played". The first one is Game of Life that is completely pointless game with no defined endpoint. The second one is classic Snake. You know Snake, right?
